##This is a project template for LMTechub students. ##Few steps to get started

- Clone the repository in the created folder for your project using: "git clone git@github.com:promise-J/LMTechub_Javascript_Template.git ./"
- Run rm -fr .git to destroy any previous git connection with the cloned remote repo
- From the terminal in your project folder, run the command "npm install" (You should see a generated node_modules folder)
- create a new branch feature using "git branch feature" then check out to the branch
- MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT COMMIT TO THE MAIN BRANCH
- Follow the project layout in adding your HTML, CSS AND Images to the project
- To test your lint check for HTML run "npm run lint:html"
- To test your lint check for CSS run "npm run lint:css"
- To test your lint check for both HTML and CSS files (both HTML and CSS) run "npm run lint:all"
- To test your lint check for Javascript run "npm run js-lint"
- To fix your lint error/warnings for css files run "npm run fix:lint:css"
- To fix your lint error/warnings for javascript files run "npm run js-lint-fix"
- Only when your lints checks are completed, get started to git, link to your remote repository, commit changes, push changes.
- After changes have been pushed, make a pull request between the feature branch and the main branch.

Make sure to update this README.md file with the usual as in the HTML/CSS Module. Tag your instructor and supervisor.
Feel free to create a file(s) as the need arises.
